Melissa is a doctoral student in Developmental Psychology & Education at the University of Toronto. 
Her research examines the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) in predicting students’ internal beliefs about learning and assessing children’s oral proficiency in English language. 
She is also interested in computational psychometrics and automated assessments. Melissa’s collaborative work involves the development of a digital language and literacy assessment tool for students and teachers. 
The tool is used to differentiate students’ proficiency levels by identifying linguistic and cognitive markers. 
It also supports students’ literacy development through scaffolded meta-cognitive and self-regulated learning interventions.
